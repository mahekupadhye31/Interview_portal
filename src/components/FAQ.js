      content: ` The term GitHub might be new for most of you. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. A great feature of GitHub is that it allows us, developers, to update your code and tracks our changes. This means that you can update and improve your code after submitting its link in the form. `,

I know the command-line tool of Git is difficult. But it's a skill worth learning for this interview as well as any internship interviews in the future.`,

      title: "Can I refer to code/templates from websites?",
      content: `The tasks are aimed to help you learn the concepts of development in a pragmatic environment. Referring to or using ready made code snippets or templates will only hinder your learning progress and they might have an adverse impact when we ask you questions pertaining to these concepts. Thus, we strongly advise against the use of templates and code snippets. You may use them as a reference to fix a bug but do not copy paste it as is. We will know :)  `,
